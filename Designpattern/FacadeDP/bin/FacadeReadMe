Notes on the Facade Design Pattern

The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
It hides the complexities of the system and exposes a unified interface to the client, making it easier to use.
Key Concepts

Definition: 
	The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use and reducing dependencies between clients and the subsystem.
Purpose:
	 The main goal of the Facade pattern is to simplify interactions with complex systems by providing a high-level interface that clients can use without needing to understand the underlying complexities.
Components:

Facade:
	 A class that provides a simplified interface to the subsystem.
Subsystem Classes:
	 The classes that implement the complex functionality. The facade delegates calls to these classes.
	 
When to Use

When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
When you want to decouple a client from the subsystem, promoting subsystem independence and portability.
When you want to minimize dependencies between clients and implementation classes.

Advantages

Simplified Interface: 
	Clients can interact with the subsystem through a single, simplified interface.
Reduced Coupling:
	 Clients are decoupled from the subsystem, making it easier to change the subsystem without affecting client code.
Improved Maintainability:
	 Changes in the subsystem can be made independently of the client as long as the facade interface remains consistent.
Easier Testing:
	The facade can be tested independently, simplifying the testing process.

Disadvantages

Increased Complexity:
	 Introducing a facade can add an extra layer of abstraction, which may complicate the system.
Reduced Flexibility:
	 The facade may limit access to specific functionalities hidden within the subsystem.
Overengineering:
	 Applying the facade pattern to simple systems can introduce unnecessary complexity.
Performance Overhead:
	 The additional layer may introduce slight performance overhead, especially for frequently used operations.
