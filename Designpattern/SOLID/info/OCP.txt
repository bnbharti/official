This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without changing its existing code,
 promoting better maintainability and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
Key Aspects of OCP

Open for Extension: 
		New functionality can be added to a system without altering existing code. 
This is typically achieved through mechanisms like inheritance or interfaces, allowing developers to introduce new classes or methods that extend the behavior of existing ones.
Closed for Modification: 
		Existing code should remain unchanged when new features are added.
 This helps to preserve the stability and reliability of the system, as modifications to existing code can lead to unintended side effects.
