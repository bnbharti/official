		 
		 Key Concepts of the Open/Closed Principle
		 
Open for Extension: 
		This means that the behavior of a module can be extended to accommodate new requirements. 
For example, you can add new classes or methods that enhance the functionality of existing code.
Closed for Modification: 
		Existing code should not be changed when new functionality is added. 
This helps ensure that previously tested and stable code remains intact, reducing the likelihood of introducing new defects.
