The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) :-
	 It states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. 
	 In other words, many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
			Key Points of Interface Segregation Principle
1  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
2  Interfaces should be client-specific and focused on a specific set of methods.
3  Interfaces should be small and focused on a specific set of methods.
4  Clients should not be forced to implement methods they do not need.

		Benefits of Interface Segregation Principle
Reduced complexity:
		 By breaking down interfaces into smaller, more focused ones, the overall complexity of the system is reduced.
Flexibility:
		 Clients can choose which interfaces to implement, making the system more flexible and adaptable.
Maintainability:
		 Changes in one interface are less likely to affect other interfaces or clients, improving maintainability.
