SRP:-
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  It asserts that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job. 
 This principle helps create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible code.

Benefits of SRP
Improved Readability:
 		Classes with a single responsibility are easier to read and understand, as they focus on one specific task.
Easier Testing:
		 Isolated responsibilities make unit testing simpler, as each class can be tested independently.
Reduced Complexity:
		 By breaking down complex classes into simpler ones, the overall complexity of the system is reduced.
Enhanced Flexibility:
		 Changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts, making the system more adaptable to change.
