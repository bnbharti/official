Key Changes
Volatile Keyword:
 		The singleton variable is declared as volatile. 
 		This ensures that any thread that accesses the singleton
 		 variable will see the most up-to-date value.
Synchronizing on the Class: 
		The synchronization block now synchronizes on Singleton.class 
		instead of singleton. This prevents the NullPointerException and 
		ensures that all threads synchronize on the same monitor.
Private Constructor: 
		The constructor is private to prevent instantiation 
		from outside the class.
